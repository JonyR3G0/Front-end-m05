## ℹ️ About

A collection of hands-on exercises crafted by [me](https://github.com/JonyR3G0), from an intensive modern JavaScript module imparted by [Dev.f](https://devf.la/). The exercises cover fundamental areas:

* **Asynchronicity:** Event Loop, Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await.
* **API Consumption:** Using the Fetch API and Axios for endpoint interaction.
* **Development Tooling:** Introduction to the Node.js ecosystem, package management with npm, and module bundling with Vite.
